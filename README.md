# Football-Analysis-Using-Markov-Chain-Process-A-Case-Study-of-FC-Barcelona-Against-Real-Madrid-FC-
ABSTRACT: Markov Chain Analysis, a case study of FC Barcelona vs Real Madrid 
FC was performed. Some important cases of this research such as the Primera 
Division (La Liga), Copa Del Rey, SuperCopa De Espana and the Champions League 
have been statistically studied. We studied when both Football clubs are at 
home and at away and their probabilities/chances of winning, drawing and losing 
a match. We also studied the possibility/chances of their matches producing 
over/under 1.5goals and over/under 2.5 goals. We studied the probability/chance 
of winning, drawing or losing two consecutive matches, and winning-drawing, 
winning-losing, drawing-winning, drawing-losing, losing-winning, and losingdrawing
two straight matches. We found out from our study that FC Barcelona 
did well/better in the Copa Del Rey Cup and the Champions League competitions, 
while Real Madrid FC did better/well in Primera Division (La Liga) and the 
SuperCopa De Espana competitions, we also found out that their matches have 
high chances of playing over 1.5 and over 2.5.
